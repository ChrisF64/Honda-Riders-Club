                <h2>A Little About Us</h2>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div id="about_us_p">
                <p> As the club name suggests, we are a group of motorcycle enthusiasts (predominantly Honda riders).
                    The
                    club was founded 25 years ago and currently has 158 members. We meet up at least once a month for
                    weekend spins (weather
                    permitting) and showcase our bikes, exchange stories, help each other with bike issues etc.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Life can be a long, difficult ride but can be better if you don't ride alone. Our club is for all
                    those
                    riders who enjoy the journey more than the goal, for all who don't think where they go when they
                    jump on
                    their bike, but just go.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If riding your bike feels like freedom... if you like to feel the road and leave everything else
                    behind,
                    if you enjoy meeting people and sharing experiences whether good or bad... then put your gear on and
                    come join us.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Honda Riders Club was founded in 1985.
                    Several of the founding members are still active and enthusiastic members today. One of the original
                    aims of the club was to provide a forum where people who were enthusiastic or had an interest in
                    touring
                    on motorcycles could talk about motorcycles, share experience of trips, share collective technical
                    knowledge and most of all, share the absolute joy of riding Honda motorcycles with like-minded
                    people.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We are the largest Honda motorcycle club in Ireland and we currently have a
                    membership of 158 with a good balance of male and female members. In addition, we have 67 “pillion
                    members”
                    who ride with their partners.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The activities for which our club is best known are our two open rallies. The Riders Rally which is
                    one
                    of the last “point to point” rally’s in Europe, entails biking over 900Km on Irish secondary roads
                    (some
                    of the best in the world) will be held on the weekend of the 14th, 15th and 16th June 2024. We
                    celebrated it’s 40th anniversary in 2014. The Way West Rally is a hotel based rally held in November
                    each year. The Way West celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2013 with an attendance in excess of 175
                    people.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The club organizes other ride-outs and over-nights throughout the year. We have a monthly ride-out,
                    usually on the third Sunday of each month. Informal spins are held on many other Sundays and are
                    advised
                    to members by email.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Family BBQ is an opportunity to meet with each other’s families who may not
                    be
                    motorcycle enthusiasts. Many of our members are enthusiastic participants in The Irish Photo Rally
                    and
                    indeed some members organize and enjoy longer tours in Europe and further afield each year.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On the last Tuesday of each month (See Events Section for schedule), we meet for a social evening
                    from
                    7:30 pm to 9:30 in Shankill Tennis Club, Shankill, Co Dublin. Over a cup of tea or coffee, we
                    indulge in
                    good-natured “banter”, catching up with old friends, planning our next trips, hearing about recent
                    trips
                    and welcoming new members to the club.</p>
