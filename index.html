                        <p>
                            As the club name suggests, we are a group of motorcycle enthusiasts (predominantly Honda
                            riders). The
                            club was founded 25 years ago and we meet up at least once a month for weekend spins,
                            showcase our
                            bikes, exchange stories, help each other with bike issues etc
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the last Tuesday of each month (See Events Section for schedule), we meet for a social
                            evening
                            from 7:30 pm to 9:30 in Shankill Tennis Club, Shankill, Co Dublin. We indulge in
                            good-natured
                            “banter”,
                            catching up with old friends, planning trips, hearing about trips, and welcoming new members
                            to the
                            club.

                            Our club is for all
                            those riders who enjoy the journey more than the goal, for all who don't think about where
                            they are
                            going when they jump on their bike, but just go.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If riding your bike feels like freedom... if you like to feel the road and leave everything
                            else behind,then put your gear on and come join us.

                            Several of the founding members are still active and
                            enthusiastic members today. One of the original aims of the club was to provide a forum
                            where bike enthusiasts could talk about motorcycles
                            with
                            like-minded people.

                            The activities for which our club is best known are our two open rallies. The Riders Rally
                            which
                            is one of the last “point to point” rally’s in Europe, entails biking over 900Km on Irish
                            secondary
                            roads (some of the best in the world) will be held on the weekend of the 14th, 15th and 16th
                            June
                            2024.
                            The Family BBQ is an opportunity to meet with each other’s families who may not
                            be motorcycle enthusiasts.
