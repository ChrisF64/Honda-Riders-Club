## Introduction
This website was made to provide information regarding a fictional motorcycle club based out of Dublin, Ireland. The target audience is the bike community of Ireland. 

This website was made for the first of five Milestone projects required to complete the Diploma in Software development program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements of this project are to build a responsive and static front-end site to present useful information to users using all the technologies learned so far, namely HTML5 and CSS3. The site is to contain no less than three pages.

3. As a current user, I want to easily navigate to content I have previously viewed within a small number of steps.

#### New User Goals
1. As a new user, I want to easily navigate the entire site intuitively. 
2. As a new user, I want the information I seek to be easily accessible and relevant.
